# Introduction

> This is a step by step guide/refresher for software technical interviews.
> The focus is on getting all things in one place so as to serve as a single, structured refresher source for programming interviews.

## What

- Information about basics, coding, system design is provided.
- Structured preparation steps based on different patterns.
- Recommended questions with [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) practice links.
- Ready python solutions for quick refresher
- References for further exploration

## Why

- Multiple excellent interview preparation guides exist today.
- A few of these references are provided in the [external references](external.md) page.
- These resources and practice guides help a lot during the initial preparation stages where the focus is on getting coding practice and mental preparation.
- But, when a quick refresher is needed, one needs to navigate through multiple places to collect the problem statements, solutions, sequence to go about them, etc.
- This site aims to provide a solution to this problem.

## Format

- Every coding problem has tags related to data structure used, best suited algorithm, relevant pattern and difficulty level of the problem. Also a practice link to Leetcode is provided.
- Preparation can be done using different methods like
  - Weekly level increase.
  - Pattern based approach.
  - Data structure based approach.
- Recommended sequence based on each approach is provided.

## Tip

> When preparing for interviews make sure that you have PRACTICED coding using online judges like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
> This site serves as a quick refresher place rather than a practice arena.
